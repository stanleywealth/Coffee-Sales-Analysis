# Coffee-Beans-Sales-Analysis

### Project Overview 

The goal for this analysis is to show the sales of our different types of coffee bean sales across three different countries over the period of 2019 - 2020. The dashboard visualization should show the following
- Sales by country
- Top selling product type

The metrics should be filtered by date, coffee type and sizes.

### Data Source

The made up data was gotten from kaggle, imported into Microsoft Excel for cleaning and analysis. The data came with three csv file named orders, customers, and products.


### Tools

The coffee beans sales analysis was done using Microsoft Excel for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the sales data.


### Cleaning, Analyzing and Visualizing the Data

#### 1. Data Cleaning/Preparation

1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

During the cleaning, the data was checked for any duplicates and removed. Also blanks/empty data was check for and there was none. Data type of each column was corrected and properly formated.
New columns were created (Customer name, country, coffee type, size, unit price, sales, loyalty cards) in other to get all the neccessary columns needed for pivot tables and charts in one sheet, this is to allow for proper visualization of the data.
Various formulas such as IF STATEMENTS, XLOOKUP, and INDEX MATCH where used to fill up new columns.

### 2. Analyzing Data 

In analyzing the data, i used Excel Pivot Table because this helps analyzing data easy in excel and also create pivot charts which helps create dashboards in excel. I created the pivot table based on the questions the needed to be answered which are:
1. What are the top customers of the company
2. Which country buy our coffee the most
3. What is our sales overtime
4. Number of customers that has our loyalty card

### Visualization
The pivot tables created was then used to create the pivot charts for each of the visualization needed for the dashboard. This include the top customers, sales by country, sales trend for each coffee type.
